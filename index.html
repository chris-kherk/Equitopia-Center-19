                    BUT before you start worrying, some breeds can already handle some intense heat! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arabian horses were specifically built to handle the extreme heat. They were bred in the Arabian peninsula to survive in those harsh hot climates with breeders choosing several unique characteristics. Most notably, their nostrils have large openings for heat dispersal, and they have added capacity in their sinuses to increase oxygen intake. They are also thinner and more angular so they do not give off a lot of heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Thoroughbred is another breed that can do better in strong heat because it has similar features to Arabians since their lineage goes back to a stock of Arabian horses imported into England.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And one interesting breed that is good with the heat is the Florida Cracker horse which is endangered. It is derived from the Spaniards’ horses that they brought over. These horses are well suited and resilient to the heat and rough terrain of the southern landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the rest of our horse breeds are derived from cool climates so we need to especially help those breeds with any intense heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help all our horses we need to continue what we are already doing now but we are going to have to notch this up by 1,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality many barns need to be rebuilt and redesigned to handle the heat. Specifically we need to look at how equestrians in the Middle East and Africa care for their horses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will need to have white or light colored roofs to reflect sunlight, attic fans to suck out air, and lots of ventilation. Lean to's or sheds out in paddocks should have white or light roofs and our fields need some help too.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                <div style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <p>
                        Our fields or pastures should be redesigned or allowed to grow so that they can take in more effectively carbon dioxide. And the big thing that always gets me is seeing these big fields with absolutely no natural shade coverings. No trees at all and this needs to stop. We need trees in our fields and we should replant trees in our horse’s fields to not only give them more shade but to again pull in more carbon dioxide.

                    But still even with these changes we may get to a point where certain spots are just too hot for horses to live healthily. And that may be in 100 years, 50 years, 10 years or even in a couple. It all depends on how much our society chooses to tackle climate change now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As heat can cause all sorts of problems for our horses, so can those extreme fluctuating weather patterns we are starting to see more and more of! Where we drop or rise by more than 20 degrees in a few hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can physically cause illness, colic, foot issues, skin diseases, and many other health issues in our horses. A horse's behavior may turn from bright to dull, they may not move much, they may be more alert, they may change their eating habits, and not drink as much water.

                    <p>
                        Along with fluctuating weather we can get bursts of intense storms that can cause dangerous flooding. The warmer temperatures we are seeing from climate change increase evaporation in the atmosphere which leads to all of that water needing to get released either through rainfall or snow.

                    When flooding occurs, horses can handle water up to their bellies for 48-72 hours depending on their health. BUT they will be heavily distressed and will probably get sick after the waters go away if they do not end up getting swept away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in an area that even has the slightest chance of flooding, you should have an emergency plan in place for you, your family and your horse! And what climate change is showing us is that flooding can happen in areas that you least expected.
